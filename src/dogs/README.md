# Dogs

An example that shows some of the key concepts of abstraction and encapsulation in object-oriented programming, including:

- a `Dog` class definition that includes:
  - overloaded constructor functions
  - `private` properties
  - `getter` method examples
  - `setter` method example with validation
  - non-`static` properties and methods that belong to each object
  - a `static` property and a `static` method that belong to the class
- a `TestDog` file that instantiates a few dog objects and toys around with them.
